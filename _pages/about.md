I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University. In 2025, I completed my PhD at the Center for the Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education in the University of Michigan's Marsal School of Education, studying under Kevin Stange and Lisa Lattuca. I hold a MA in Higher Education from the University of Michigan and a BA in Mathematics and Philosophy from Lawrence University. Drawing on tools from computational social science and natural language processing, I study student's curricular pathways through higher education institutions in the United States and the place of the traditional liberal arts curriculum in the postsecondary landscape.

In my research, I combine novel large-scale data sources like the text of syllabi and course catalogs with administrative student transcripts to understand how students navigate the complex postsecondary curriculum, the role coursework can play in developing skills, and the role curricular structure and content plays in educational opportunity. My dissertation focuses on general education and the development of general skills in Texas. In my dissertation, I use a longitudinal corpus of more than syllabi 800,000 that I have linked with student transcripts and wage records to study how class content and instructional practices affect students.

I was a 2024 Spencer/National Academy of Education Dissertation Fellow and an Institute of Education Sciences Predoctoral Fellow in Causal Inference in Education Policy Research at the Ford School of Public Policy. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a residence hall director at Lawrence University. My work using natural language processing and generative language models to make postsecondary curriculum legible at scale has secured $977,500 in grant funding from the Institute of Education Sciences, Michigan Institute for Data Science, and the Center for Academic Innovation at the University of Michigan.
